# Used vehicle comparison bot
## Clointfusion Hackathon 9.0
A bot using clointfusion which takes user input as city name and car name/model and retrieves the car information from the cars24 website, store it in an excel sheet and then email it to the user. The excel sheet will have the city name, the car name/model and the current date as the name. The bot will only work if the python and json files are stored in this location - C:\Cars24_car_details_download_automation. The excel sheets and the zip files are also stored in the same location. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0uL6C3bM9g&ab_channel=MohammadYawar
